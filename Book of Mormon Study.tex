This book was written because of the spirit of prophecy, which as we find in Revelation 19:10 is the testimony of Christ, but it was also written because it was a commandment.  This leads to the thought that as we develop a testimony of Christ, we will be commanded to write our own testimony so that others can learn from our own experience.

Including the abridgement of the Book of Ether is done to show that God is powerful, and watches out for those that serve Him.  Furthermore, this record gives another witness of the importance of the covenants of the Lord - without them, we are cast off forever.  The final statement in this paragraph is a warning to those that would find fault with the book.  Mormon readily acknowledges that he may have made a mistake, and implores those that read and ponder this book that they learn from his mistakes, rather than condemn the book because of his weakness.

Joseph Smith stated that ``The standard of truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done."  We have a work to do, and this book is the way to do it!

\begin{quote}
``The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible. It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel."
\end{quote}

\subsection{Definitions\label{intro:DFN1}}
\emph{Comparable}: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item capable of being compared; having features in common with something else to permit or suggest comparison
  \item worthy of comparison
  \item usable for comparison; similar
\end{itemize}
\emph{Fulness} (or \emph{Fullness}): 
\begin{itemize}
  \item completely filled; containing all that can be held; filled to utmost capacity
  \item complete; entire; maximum
  \item of the maximum size, amount, extent, volume, etc.
\end{itemize}
\emph{Everlasting} (as adjective):
\begin{itemize}
  \item lasting forever; eternal
  \item lasting or continuing for an indefinitely long time
  \item incessant; constantly recurring
  \item wearisome; tedious
\end{itemize}
\emph{Everlasting} (as noun):
\begin{itemize}
  \item eternal duration; eternity
  \item the Everlasting, God
  \item any of various plants that retain their shape or color when dried, as certain composite plants of the genera \emph{Helichrysum}, \emph{Gnaphalium}, and \emph{Helipterum}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Principles\label{intro:principles1}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \index{Gospel} Fulness of the gospel
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments\label{intro:comments1}}
Just as we say in the eighth Article of Faith, ``We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God."  The Bible does contain the fulness of the gospel - faith, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.  We use the Book of Mormon as another witness of Jesus Christ and His gospel.  In my personal opinion, the Book of Mormon is clearer in its language in describing the gospel and what we must do in order to return to God again.  When we speak of the everlasting gospel, if we look at the definitions above, we are in fact saying that we are looking at God's gospel.  The use of the word \emph{comparable} is informative as well.  We do not say that the Bible and the Book of Mormon are \emph{the same}.  Rather, they share the same information, but do so with two completely different groups of people.  Note that the first definition of comparable mentions having features in common -- the implication is that not everything is the same.

Another comment on this paragraph is that in recent years the phrase ``as does the Bible" was removed from the introduction.  I do not think that this removal was done to imply that the Bible does not contain the fulness of the gospel, but rather that the introduction is just a starting point for those who are beginning to read the Book of Mormon.  Thus, the introduction focuses on the words contained in the Book of Mormon, without detracting from the importance of the Bible.

\begin{center}
\begin{quote}
``The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation.  Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon.  The record gives an account of two civilizations.  One came from Jerusalem in 600 \scriptsize B.C. \normalsize and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites.  The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel.  This group is known as the Jaredites.  After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians."

\subsection{Comments\label{intro:comments2}}
This paragraph once again reaffirms that the Book of Mormon was written by prophets by revelation.  This book did not come out of a whim like many  of the novels and stories we read today.  This book was written as a commandment of God, and as such requires (and should \emph{command}) our deepest attentions and studies.  Note that this particular paragraph was updated in recent years.  The original paragraph read, at the end ``... they are among the principal ancestors of the American Indians."  Why this was changed, I do not know, but one thought that I have on that matter is that the Nephites, Lamanites, and Jaredites may not have been the only ones to settle on the American continent. While we may not have the records of other civilizations, that does not preclude them from having living and intermingling with the groups.  After all, there are the lost ten tribes of Israel, and there is a possibility that some of those lost tribes found their way to the Americas and are also among the ancestors of the American Indians.  Something that should stick out as a big warning to everyone is the phrase, ``all were destroyed except the Lamanites."  Having read the Book of Mormon many times, and knowing how both civilizations were destroyed, this scares me especially because of the parallels I see in the United States today.  While I am not sure that the United States alone was the home of these civilizations, it seems quite possible to me that the entirety of both North and South America were well traveled by these groups, and that the commandment of God that those who dwell in the land shall serve Him applies across the board.  Thus, it seems to me, that if we do not repent, there is a strong possibility that destruction will come our way from other groups.  I have to be careful in saying this though, because I do not mean to imply that the other countries in North and South America are wicked (as could be implied from the United States being destroyed by them similar to the Nephites).  That is certainly not my place to judge, especially as I have absolutely no idea the spiritual state of those peoples.  Rather, I mean to say that the Lord in His justice will not wait much longer for His children to repent before wars begin to break out -- not in this land alone, but across the world.

\subsection{Comments\label{intro:comments3}}
Something that has always meant a lot to me is just how individually focused Christ is.  Throughout the Bible and the Book of Mormon, Christ shows us what it means to truly be selfless.  He shows such an infinite capacity for love that has always soothed my soul and driven me to work to become better, and more worthy of His love.  

This paragraph emphasizes that Christ is the focal point of this book.  His doctrine, His gospel, and the plan that He carried out are explained in greater detail in this book than in any other book.  It only makes sense that of all the books that can be studied, this one alone will bring a man closer to God than any other book, because it truly is ``the most correct of any book."

``After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah.

\subsection{Comments\label{intro:comments4}}
This paragraph covers a lot of ground in such a short space -- from Moroni receiving the plates (approximately 400 \scriptsize A.D. \normalsize) to 1823, a span of nearly a millennium and a half.  The use of the word \emph{destined} is interesting to me.  While this introduction was written after the translation of the Book of Mormon into English, it is quite clear in the Book of Mormon itself that the authors knew that it would be translated into another language.

Something that has given me pause is the idea that Moroni was a glorified, \emph{resurrected} being.  Keep in mind that at the time of Moroni's death, Christ had already started the first resurrection nearly 400 years previous.  Alma indicates that there could be one resurrection and a final resurrection, a continuous resurrection, or a series of resurrections (see Alma 40).  If there were only two resurrections, that would indicate that both resurrections have already happened (the first being with Christ, the second being some time after the death of Moroni).  This does not sit well with me, so we look at the other two possibilities.  For the continuous resurrection idea, this seems slightly more plausible.  We know that when Christ was resurrected, many of the dead rose as well (see Matthew 27:52).  If that first resurrection began a continuous cycle of resurrection, this makes much more sense.  There could be an indeterminate amount of time between death and resurrection, as President Joseph F. Smith seems to indicate that Joseph Smith (who had died some 64 years previous) was still in the spirit world, and with others of the last dispensation, ``looked upon the long absence of their spirits from their bodies as a bondage." (see D\&C 138(:50)).  This bring us to the idea of a series of resurrections.  This idea stems from the fact that people simply do not experience death at the same time.  In a way, this could be viewed as a parody on the continuous resurrection idea, just with more spacing between resurrection `events.'  One thing that needs to be considered is that we have absolutely \emph{no} idea what the ordinance of resurrection entails (see \Cref{intro:references4} for further study).  Because of this, we can only speculate, but further study by faith and learning may provide further answers.

The idea of the Book of Mormon being the keystone of our religion is an important one.  Without the Book of Mormon, we have absolutely no claim that we are Christ's church restored to the earth.  Without the Book of Mormon, we have absolutely no claim that we have the power of God within our church in the priesthood.  We cannot claim to receive revelation, we cannot claim to have a modern prophet, and we cannot claim any of the knowledge that we have is true, if we do not have the Book of Mormon.  The Book of Mormon testifies in its purity of the simple truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Because of its truth and divinity, we have what we have -- prophets, revelation, the priesthood, and a whole host of wonderful blessings that I really need to spend more time thinking about.  This book is \emph{precious}!

\subsection{Comments\label{intro:comments7}}
Throughout the history of mankind, God has operated under the Law of Witnesses, which is in essence that at least two testimonies must come forth to establish the truth of something (see Deuteronomy 19:15, 2 Corinthians 13:1 and 1 Timothy 5:19).  The Book of Mormon is a part of this law as it, along with the Bible, testifies of the divinity of Christ.  The law is that two or three witnesses must establish the truth, so the Book of Mormon itself needs the support of this law.  This support is found in the form of the testimonies of the prophet Joseph Smith (1), the testimonies of the Three Witnesses (2), and the testimonies of the Eight Witnesses (3).  By these testimonies is the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon established.  Any further testimonies lend further credence to the original statement, but do not change the impact.  However, I would point out that our own testimonies can act as a witness of sorts to those that are seeking the truth.  If we seek to help those around us to come to know God in a deeper way, we can plant the seed of faith with our testimony.  As they hear the testimonies of the missionaries, that can be a second witness of the truth to them.  Furthermore, as they gain their own witness from their own study of the Book of Mormon, they experience their own example of the Law of Witnesses.

Something of interest to me is that part of the testimonies of these three sets of witnesses relates to the actual existence of the gold plates.  To me, this seems like a non-issue.  If God had commanded Joseph Smith to write down these words, seemingly pulling them out of thin air, I suppose that could make it more difficult to believe.  But the words themselves offer the challenge (as shown in \Cref{intro:8th}), which in essence tells us to not take the words of those who have testified before, but to become a witness ourselves.

\subsection{Comments\label{intro:comments8}}
This book has a powerful promise.  It promises that if we ask God, in the name of Christ, if the book is true, then we will know by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true.  This book encourages us to test it, to actually hold it up to the light it professes to have, and determine if it is true, or if it is simply a good story.  The promise is that its truth will be revealed to you. The requirement is that you simply put in the effort to know.  You can't test something if you don't have the necessary knowledge - a test is a way to determine the difference between what you know and what is (taught to be) right.

\subsection{Comments\label{intro:comment9}}
God teaches us in a way that helps us best to understand.  If we have learned something from Him in a certain way (i.e. a burning of the bosom, or words spoken into our minds), it is a safe assumption that further light and knowledge from Him will come similarly.  The scriptures state that God is not a changeable being (see Moroni 8:18), so He will not suddenly try a method on us that won't work.  That being said, God has known us much longer than we currently know ourselves.  We existed with Him before the foundation of the world (see Jeremiah 1:5), and since we cannot remember that time in our life, God knows us intimately, and much better than we know ourselves.  Because of this knowledge, God knows \emph{exactly} how to teach us.  There may be ways that we have to prepare ourselves for, but God doesn't `experiment' with His children.  After all, this existence is a test for us as His children to see whom we will follow: God, or Satan.

It is important to note that the same feelings and testimony that we gain regarding the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon will also apply to Christ being our Savior, Joseph Smith being Christ's prophet on the earth in the last days, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints being the Lord's established kingdom on the earth.  In much the same way, the Holy Ghost will testify of the truthfulness of the Bible, and by extension that Christ is our Savior, that prophets were called in those days, and that Christ's kingdom had been established on the earth (and here I will add that His kingdom was taken from the earth due to wickedness).  Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon warn of the things to come in the last days.  We must prepare now for the coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  We must be found worthy and prepared at His coming.  Only God knows exactly when Christ will return, but until then we must vigilantly watch and pray, and prepare our lamps for the Bridegroom.

\section{Three Witnesses\label{3witness}}
\begin{center}
\begin{quote}
``Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower which hath been spoken.  And we also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true.  And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man.  And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are true.  And it is marvelous in our eyes.  Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things. And we know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens.  And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God.  Amen."

\subsection{Comments\label{3witness:comments}}
Something that is interesting to me is looking into the subsequent events that occurred to the three witnesses.  After having the incredible experience which they explained, some years later all of them fell away from the church.  Some of them did come back, but it astounds me that they did fall away.  Even more astonishing is the fact that despite their falling away, they never did deny the testimony written here (see \Cref{intro:references7}).  These three men, who saw an angel, who viewed the plates upon which were written the history of the Nephites and the Lamanites, as well as an abridgment of the history of the Jaredites, fell away from the church that they knew to be true.  This stands as a warning to me of the need for constant vigilance in keeping my faith strong.

An important point about this witness: the physical senses with which these men testify of the truth are sight and sound - \emph{seen} the engravings... \emph{shown} unto us... laid before our \emph{eyes} ... been \emph{spoken}... \emph{voice} hath declared.  They received a commandment from God that they should bear record of the Book of Mormon, and they obediently kept that commandment.  This is important!  If they had not kept that commandment, they likely would have been destroyed, for ``no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing."  That said, that is my \emph{opinion}, and should not be taken as fact.

\subsection{Comments\label{8witness:comment}}
This witness is slightly different from the witness given by the Three Witnesses.  This testimony explicitly states that they held the plates with their hands, and felt it's physical form.  The witness given by the Three says they \emph{saw} the plates as shown unto them by an angel.  This is a way to verify the witnesses, as one could be said to have had a spiritual experience, while they others had a physical experience.

Important points about this witness: the witness is based on the physical senses of sight and touch, different from the witness given by the Three Witnesses.  The words used are: \emph{shown} unto us... \emph{handle} with our hands... we also \emph{saw}... \emph{shown} unto us... we have \emph{seen} and \emph{hefted}.

\subsubsection{Comments\label{js:comments2}}
If supplication is `humble prayer,' this sentence reads that Joseph Smith turned to prayer and humble prayer to God.  This indicates a gradation of sorts in the types of prayers we can offer.  Prayer, in and of itself, is the act of communicating with God.  The Bible Dictionary definition of prayer states that ``Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other." Simple prayer (the first prayer that Joseph Smith indicates) may be less focused on aligning our will with God, but rather more focused on saying things that are going on.  Humble prayer on the other hand evokes an idea of submissiveness, which aligns well with the idea given in the Bible Dictionary definition.

There is also a subtle reminder of the importance of keeping a personal record.  I don't know when Joseph Smith wrote this particular testimony, but it seems to me like he may have referenced a journal to pull out the specific date.  It is absolutely possible that he remembered the day though.
