\section{Comments\label{titlePage:comments2}}
This book was written because of the spirit of prophecy, which as we find in Revelation 19:10 is the testimony of Christ, but it was also written because it was a commandment.  This leads to the thought that as we develop a testimony of Christ, we will be commanded to write our own testimony so that others can learn from our own experience.

\quote{``An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to heaven - Which is to shown unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever - And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations - and now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ."}

\section{Comments\label{titlePage_comments3}}
Including the abridgement of the Book of Ether is done to show that God is powerful, and watches out for those that serve Him.  Furthermore, this record gives another witness of the importance of the covenants of the Lord - without them, we are cast off forever.  The final statement in this paragraph is a warning to those that would find fault with the book.  Mormon readily acknowledges that he may have made a mistake, and implores those that read and ponder this book that they learn from his mistakes, rather than condemn the book because of his weakness.

Joseph Smith stated that ``The standard of truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done."  We have a work to do, and this book is the way to do it!
